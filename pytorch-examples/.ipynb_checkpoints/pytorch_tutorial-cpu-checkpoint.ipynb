The biggest difference between the two is that TensorFlow's computational graphs are static and PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs:   \n",

If you are reusing the same graph over and over, then this potentially costly up-front optimization can be amortized as the same graph is rerun over and over.  \n",

With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this reason TensorFlow provides operators such as tf.scan for embedding loops into the graph.  \n",
