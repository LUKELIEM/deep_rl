    "## TensorFlow: Static Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch autograd looks a lot like TensorFlow: in both frameworks we define a computational graph, and use automatic differentiation to compute gradients. The biggest difference between the two is that TensorFlow's computational graphs are static and PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs:   \n",
    "\n",
    "* TensorFlow, we define the computational graph once and then execute the same graph over and over again, possibly feeding different input data to the graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* PyTorch, each forward pass defines a new computational graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Static graphs are nice because you can optimize the graph up front; for example a framework might decide to fuse some graph operations for efficiency, or to come up with a strategy for distributing the graph across many GPUs or many machines. If you are reusing the same graph over and over, then this potentially costly up-front optimization can be amortized as the same graph is rerun over and over.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect where static and dynamic graphs differ is control flow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For some models we may wish to perform different computation for each data point; for example a recurrent network might be unrolled for different numbers of time steps for each data point; this unrolling can be implemented as a loop. With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this reason TensorFlow provides operators such as tf.scan for embedding loops into the graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With dynamic graphs the situation is simpler: since we build graphs on-the-fly for each example, we can use normal imperative flow control to perform computation that differs for each input.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To contrast with the PyTorch autograd example above, this is how Tensorflow fit a simple two-layer net:\n",
